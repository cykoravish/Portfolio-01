            <h1>MY DARK SECRETS</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm agnostic.</li>
                <li>My perspective is totally different about many things like marriage, relationship, genders, peoples
                    e.t.c. so i don't talk or debate with anyone about all these topics.
                </li>
                <li>This is kinda funny what happened to me a year ago because of my stupidity, i met a guy through
                    internet. He was a local there and he promissed me to provide a call girl for paid fun. Everything
                    was just fixed between us. I bought condoms, mouthfresher, wine, etc for being prepared for that
                    moment. Offcourse all of this is not for free i paid few amount in advance and promised to pay rest
                    after i'm done. And finally that moment came, i talked to that girl and a guy and they want me to
                    come to their place so i went there and when i reached there i didn't found anyone there and when i
                    called him/her they asking for more money to book a hotel and all. After all of that i figured out
                    that they scammed me and that's how my dream got broken lol.</li>
                <li>I got kinda addicted to alcohol 3 years back. Many times i came back to home after getting drunk
                    from my college and my parents weren't able to caught me because may be i would say i was kinda
                    smart.</li>
                <li><b>DARKEST DAY OF MY LIFE :-</b> I actually don't wanna say more about this topic because i don't
                    even wanna think about it. That was not just a darkest day of my life but something more.
                    And that day came into my life last year. I struggled to survive that night, my one mistake and i
                    was gonna lose my life. I saw death too close to my eyes but the good part was that GOD saved me
                    because i was praying at that scary moment</li>
                <li><b>MY DREAM GIRL:-</b> I wanna marry a girl with strong emotions, who can drink with me at night
                    bars, who can understand me better than anyone else, who can not care about society, with whome i
                    can share my internal feelings and with a open minded mentality. i don't need a girl wearing saree
                    and sindoor, showingOff, agressive nature and all.</li>
